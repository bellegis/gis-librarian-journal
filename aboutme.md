My name is Belle Lipton and I am a GIS Librarian. In my job, I support researchers working on projects where they are often learning something new. I wanted to make this site to help me "walk the walk" in taking my own advice. I believe that as we're exploring and learning, taking conscious time to synthesize and document our efforts not only makes it easier for us to understand and synthesize, it can also make our efforts more intelligible to others. I also believe that trying to explain what we are learning to others is a great way to make sure we understand it ourselves.



I like the rule of thumb, in a GIS-learning context, for instance, that if we have an hour to work on a project, a good ratio is to spend 70-80% of that time actually working on the task, and the rest of it concretizing for ourselves what we've done. In a world where it sometimes feels like a luxury to have time for reflection, my aim is to assert by experimentation, that what I'm describing is actually an essential part of learning. I hope to stay with this practice, even throughout the busy upcoming semesters, and hope I can contribute something to a broader landscape of GIS librarianship by sharing even short, regular updates about what I am reading and working on.
